Compiling instructions:

This is assuming you're going to be building this in debug mode.

NOTES:
-	You must be running Windows.  Sorry, this won't work on any other system yet.
-	It is highly recommended that you install the latest Windows Development Kit
	(yes install the one for Windows 8.1 even if you don't have it), and the 
	latest version of Visual Studio (with the latest Visual C++ Runtime
	Libraries).  This allows you to compile the application using visual C++
	compilers which make compatibility with Windows that much easier to
	implement.  Otherwise you'll have to use MinGW's GCC for a compiler which
	can cause issues.
- 	After you've installed the above kits (if any) you must install at least
	Qt 5.3.2.  You can download the SDK from here http://qt-project.org/
	It is recommended that you also install the Qt Creator IDE.

BUILDING:

Clone the repo, and once everything has downloaded YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING:
Open up Keyboard_Highlighter.pro (with any text editor) and change the line
"config	+=	release" to "config	+=	debug"
If you don't do this, qmake will become angry at you when you try to build the
application from a non-static Qt installation.  And yes, the Qt version you
installed is NOT a static build; the only way to get a static Qt build is if you
build Qt from source and manually configure it to be static (along with other 
options).

After you have Qt installed, you can open up the Keyboard_Highlighter.pro file
with Qt Creator and it will parse all included files as well.  Then you can
simply build the application from within Qt Creator.  If you didn't install the
IDE, you can alternatively just use Qt's qmake function to build the application
using the following commands:

cd \path\to\repo\clone
\path\to\qmake\qmake.exe -o Makefile Keyboard_Highlighter.pro
\path\to\jom\jom.exe

Alternatively you can just use nmake (but jom is recommended because it's
multithreaded):

cd \path\to\repo\clone
\path\to\qmake\qmake.exe -o Makefile Keyboard_Highlighter.pro
\path\to\nmake\nmake.exe

And that's it!  You should have a working executable for your machine.
