This is a very simple application that simply shows a window that highlights
keypresses as you type them even if the window does not have focus.  This is a
first step towards an input heatmapper similar to Razer's Heatmapping software:

It uses the Qt SDK as a multiplatform API with the hope that in the future this
will be able to work cross-platform.

Note there is a lot of room for improvement with this, and I don't intend this
to be the final rendition of this software.

See INSTALL for compiling instructions, but note you need at least Qt 5.3.2
installed on your system.
